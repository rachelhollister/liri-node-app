Meet LIRI, a language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, that is a command line node app which takes in specific parameters I have set and sends you back data very quickly!

You have the option to ask LIRI the following commands to retrieve data through node.

1. concert-this: this was developed through using an axios request of the Bands in Town Artists Events API. You simply type in the band you are searching for and LIRI will retrieve the data of the name of the venue, the venue location, and the date of event.

2. spotify-this-song: this was developed through using spotify's developer platform, and accessing my specific client-id and secret. You can enter a song to LIRI and retrieve the artist, the song name, a preview link, and album. If the input is undefined it automatically goes to a song by Ace of Base "The Sign."

3. movie-this: developed through using an axios request through IMDD. Enter a movie title for LIRI and get the following information; movie title, release year, OMDB rating, rottent tomatoes rating, country of origin, language, plot, and actors. If the user input is undefined then the movie LIRI automatiicaly goes to is "Mr.Nobody".

4. do-what-it-says: this takes the user into a seperate created .txt created. Specifically random.txt that contains a Backstreet Boys song through spotify, "I Want it That Way".

See a demo of LIRI in action at the link below through searches of Bands in Town, Spotify, and OMDB!
